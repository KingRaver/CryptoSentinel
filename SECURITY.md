# CryptoSentinel AI: Security Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented within the CryptoSentinel platform to protect data integrity, ensure user privacy, and maintain operational resilience. Our security framework follows industry best practices and standards, with particular attention to the unique requirements of the cryptocurrency analytics sector.

## Security Philosophy

CryptoSentinel's security approach is built on four core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers providing redundant protection
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal access rights for systems and personnel
3. **Secure by Design**: Security integrated into development from inception
4. **Continuous Verification**: Ongoing testing and validation of security controls

## Data Protection Architecture

### Data Classification System

All data within CryptoSentinel is classified according to sensitivity:

| Classification Level | Description | Example Data | Protection Level |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| Public | Non-sensitive information | Token names, public market data | Standard protection |
| Business Confidential | Internal business data | Aggregated analytics, non-PII user metrics | Enhanced protection |
| User Confidential | Personal user information | Account details, API keys | Strong protection |
| High Security | Critical security elements | Authentication tokens, encryption keys | Maximum protection |

### Data Flow Security

CryptoSentinel implements end-to-end security across the entire data lifecycle:

1. **Collection**
   - TLS 1.3 for all API communications
   - Certificate pinning for mobile applications
   - Input validation and sanitization

2. **Processing**
   - Secure compute environments with network isolation
   - Memory protection against common exploits
   - Runtime application self-protection (RASP)

3. **Storage**
   - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
   - Secure key management using HSM integration
   - Data partitioning based on sensitivity classification

4. **Distribution**
   - Signed API responses for data integrity verification
   - Fine-grained access controls for data retrieval
   - Content security policies for web interfaces

### Encryption Implementation

| Data State | Encryption Method | Key Management | Rotation Policy |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Data in Transit | TLS 1.3 | Automated certificate management | 90 days |
| Data at Rest | AES-256-GCM | HSM-based key storage | 180 days |
| API Authentication | HMAC-SHA256 | Secure key generation and distribution | On demand |
| Webhook Signatures | HMAC-SHA256 | Customer-specific signing secrets | Customer controlled |

## Infrastructure Security
